## 🙏 About this project

This site builds on the jekyll-theme-chirpy
, originally created by Cotes Chung.
I’ve customized and extended it to fit my personal style, projects, and goals.

Gratitude also goes to the wider open-source community, whose work and spirit of sharing continue to inspire and enable projects like this.
