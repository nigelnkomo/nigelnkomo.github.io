I am currently an ICTS (Information and Communication Technology Services) intern at the National University of Science and Technology where  I am receiving training under User Support, Software Engineering and Network Engineering units. 

Becoming more scientifically literate and a strong desire to make an impact in my community and the world are the things that truly keep me motivated.

When I am not studying or working, I enjoy taking photographs, cycling or doing yoga. I am also an aficionado of graphic design and interior design.
