### Why I'm starting here
I recently came across a documentary about Philip K. Dick, and his reputation for 
mastering the "Dystopian" genre immediately caught my attention. While I've 
always loved dystopian films, I've struggled to finish novels in the past. 
I’m using these short stories from Project Gutenberg as my entry point into 
science fiction literature.

### My Initial Thoughts
- I'm fascinated by how PKD is described as a master of bleak, unsettling futures.
- I want to see how the "dystopia" I've seen in movies translates to the written word.
